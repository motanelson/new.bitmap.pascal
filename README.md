How to Build a Custom GambaOS on Raspberry Pi Using Gambas
In the world of open-source computing, few tools are as powerful—and overlooked—as Gambas. It's a full-featured development environment inspired by Visual Basic, and when combined with a lightweight Linux base, you can create your own GambaOS: a Gambas-powered system running directly on a Raspberry Pi.

This guide walks you through building your own minimalist Raspberry Pi system with Gambas 3, a virtual machine for running Gambas applications, and a minimal GUI environment.

 What You’ll Need
A Raspberry Pi (any model, but Pi 3 or newer is recommended)

A microSD card (8GB or more)

Internet connection

A keyboard, mouse, and HDMI screen

A computer to write the SD card image

 Step 1: Flash a Minimal Raspbian Image
Download the Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit) from raspberrypi.com.

Use Raspberry Pi Imager, balenaEtcher, or dd to flash the image onto the microSD card.

Insert the card into your Pi and boot it up.

 Step 2: Update the System
Once the Pi boots and you log in:

bash
Copiar
Editar
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
 Step 3: Install a Minimal GUI (Openbox + x-terminal)
bash
Copiar
Editar
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends xorg openbox xterm lightdm
xorg: The X display server

openbox: Lightweight window manager

xterm: Simple terminal emulator

lightdm: Simple login manager

After installation, enable the GUI to launch:

bash
Copiar
Editar
sudo systemctl enable lightdm
Then reboot:

bash
Copiar
Editar
sudo reboot
 Step 4: Install Gambas 3
After rebooting into the GUI:

bash
Copiar
Editar
sudo apt install gambas3 gambas3-gb-gui gambas3-ide gambas3-runtime
This will install the Gambas IDE, its GUI components, and the virtual machine needed to execute Gambas applications.

 Step 5: Create Your Own Gambas Environment
Now you can:

Launch gambas3 from the terminal or menu

Create desktop applications visually with drag-and-drop design

Compile them for execution using the Gambas virtual machine

You’ve essentially created your own GambaOS—a system centered around the Gambas development environment and runtime!

 Optional: Autostart Gambas Apps at Boot
If you want a Gambas app to launch automatically (like a kiosk system):

Create your .gambas app and compile it.

Edit the Openbox autostart file:

bash
Copiar
Editar
nano ~/.config/openbox/autostart
Add your app path:

bash
Copiar
Editar
/path/to/your/gambas/app &
Save and reboot.

 Conclusion
Congratulations! You've now created a minimalist Linux system tailored to Gambas development and application execution—a custom GambaOS for Raspberry Pi.

This setup is perfect for:

Kiosk apps

Educational systems

Custom desktop tools

Home automation dashboards

 With Gambas, you don’t just write apps—you design your own desktop experience, powered by open-source tools.
