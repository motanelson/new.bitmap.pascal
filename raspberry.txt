 How to Install Windows IoT Core on a Raspberry Pi: A Step-by-Step Guide
The Raspberry Pi is a powerful and affordable mini-computer loved by hobbyists, engineers, and students. While most people use Linux-based systems like Raspberry Pi OS, it’s also possible to run Windows IoT Core — a lightweight version of Windows designed for smart devices and Internet of Things (IoT) projects.

Here’s a clear and simple guide on how to install Windows IoT Core on your Raspberry Pi and get started with connected development.

 What You’ll Need
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

 A Raspberry Pi 2, 3, or 3B+ (Windows IoT does not support Pi 4 officially)

 A microSD card (at least 8GB; Class 10 or higher recommended)

 A Windows 10/11 PC

 Internet connection

 A 5V 2.5A power supply for your Pi

 Keyboard, mouse, HDMI cable, and monitor (optional for headless setup)

 MicroSD card reader for your PC

 Step 1: Install Windows 10 IoT Core Dashboard
On your Windows PC:

Go to the official Microsoft IoT Developer site

Download and install the Windows 10 IoT Core Dashboard

Open the IoT Dashboard and select “Set up a new device” on the left menu

 Step 2: Set Up Your Device
In the dashboard:

Device type: Raspberry Pi 2 & 3

OS Build: Windows 10 IoT Core

Drive: Choose your SD card

Enter a device name and admin password

Optionally, check “Enable Wi-Fi” and choose your network

Accept the software license terms

Click “Download and Install”

The tool will now download the image and flash your SD card. This might take a few minutes.

 Step 3: Boot Up Your Raspberry Pi
Insert the microSD card into your Raspberry Pi

Connect your monitor, keyboard, and mouse

Plug in the power supply

The Pi will boot into Windows 10 IoT Core and display a basic UI with device info

If you enabled Wi-Fi or Ethernet, your Pi will now be on the network.

 Step 4: Connect and Develop
Back on your Windows PC, go to the IoT Dashboard and find your device listed under “My Devices”.

From there, you can:

Launch PowerShell remotely

Deploy apps using Visual Studio

Monitor performance and logs

Install updates

To create your own apps, install Visual Studio 2019 or 2022, and create a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) project targeting IoT Core.

 What Can You Build with Windows IoT?
Smart home controllers

Industrial sensors

Security camera systems

Classroom teaching tools

Robotics and automation

Windows IoT Core is lightweight, secure, and supports C#, .NET, and UWP, making it ideal for developers familiar with Microsoft tools.

 Important Notes
Windows IoT Core does NOT offer a full desktop experience — it’s designed for headless or single-purpose apps.

Not compatible with Raspberry Pi 4 without community workarounds.

For more power and desktop-like experience, consider Windows 11 ARM64 unofficial builds (not recommended for production).

 Conclusion
Installing Windows 10 IoT Core on your Raspberry Pi opens the door to a world of smart device development using Microsoft’s ecosystem. Whether you’re building a smart display, sensor system, or kiosk, the setup is surprisingly easy and well-documented.
